# RetroPieGadgets

In my tinkering with RetroPie, I've created some convenience scripts for various
things.

1. Compile Attract: Simple shell script that will compile attract-mode on  a RaspberryPi 3. It's simply taken
from the author's github page instructions and converted to a bash script. Source: https://github.com/mickelson/attract/blob/master/Compile.md

2. Fuzzy Game Match: I wrote this scripts to match game names from various top n lists to my 
catalog of roms. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well.

3. Rom Copy: I wanted a simple way to take a file with a list of roms and use that to copy the selected roms
and the associated metadata (videos, boxart, etc.)

4. Gamelists: These are the files I have used as source files for the copy-rom.py scripts. Right now these are:
    * Genesis
    * NES
    * Super NES
